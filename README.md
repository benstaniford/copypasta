# CopyPasta üìã

Cross-device clipboard sharing through a web interface. Share text and images between your devices instantly.  A docker container maintains the clipboard history and your devices can access it via the web or via native clients that watch system clipboards.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Docker (Recommended)

1. **Download and run:**
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name copypasta nerwander/copypasta:latest
   ```

2. **Or use docker-compose:**
   ```bash
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-repo/copypasta/main/docker-compose.yml
   docker compose up -d
   ```

3. **Access:** Open `http://localhost:5000` and login with `user` / `password`

### Docker Compose File

```yaml
services:
  copypasta:
    image: nerwander/copypasta:latest
    container_name: copypasta

    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - FLASK_ENV=production
      - APP_USERNAME=user
      - APP_PASSWORD=password
      - SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-change-this-in-production
